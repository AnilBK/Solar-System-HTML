<font  face="Century Gothic" color="green"><B>Although often confused, there is a distinct and important difference in the concepts of revolution and rotation.<br><br>

 <I><font color="blue"><u>Earth rotates on its axis as it revolves around the Sun .</I><br><br>

Earth rotates about its axis at approximately 15 angular degrees per hour.</u> <br><br></font>

Rotation dictates the length of the diurnal cycle (i.e, the day/night cycle), creates "time zones" with differing local noons, and also causes the apparent movement of the Moon , stars, and planets across the "celestial sphere".<br><br>


Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to complete one revolution around the Sun in a slightly elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focal point of the ellipse. <br><br>

Ranging between the extremes of perihelion (closest approach) in January and aphelion (most distant orbital position) in July, Earth's orbital distance from the Sun ranges from approximately 91.5 to approximately 94 million miles (147–151 million km), respectively.<br>

<br>

Rotation, revolution, polar tilt, parallelism, and Earth's oblate spheroid shape combine to produce an unequal distribution of solar energy , the changing of seasons, the changing lengths of day and night, and influence the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans .<br><br>

In addition to Earth's rotation about the Sun, the solar system is both moving with the Milky Way galaxy and revolving around the galactic core.<BR>
