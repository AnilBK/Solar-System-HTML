<font color="magenta"><u><i>Facts About The Sun</u></i></font><br></br>
One million Earths could fit inside the Sun:<br></br>

<b><i>If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside.</i></b>


When all the Hydrogen has been burned, the Sun will continue for about 130 million more years, burning Helium, during which time it will expand to the point that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and the Earth.<br></br>

<b><i>The Sun will one day be about the size of Earth:</b></i>
After its red giant phase, the Sun will collapse, retaining its enormous mass, but containing the approximate volume of our planet. When this happens, it will be called a white dwarf.<br></br>

<b><i>The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth.</b> </i>

<b><i>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere:</b></i>
There is only a 10 kilometre difference in its polar diameter compared to its equatorial diameter. .<br></br>

<b><i>Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth:</b></i>

The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years from the galactic centre and it takes the Sun 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.<br></br>

<i><b>The Sun is middle-aged:</i></b>
At around 4.5 billion years old, the Sun has already burned off about half of its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for approximately another 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf<br></br>

<b><i>The Sun has a very strong magnetic field:</b></i>
Solar flares occur when magnetic energy is released by the Sun during magnetic storms, which we see as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines are twisted and they spin, much like a tornado would on Earth.<br></br>

<i><b>The temperature inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius:</i></b>
At the Sun’s core, energy is generated by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Because hot objects generally expand, the Sun would explode like a giant bomb if it weren’t for its enormous gravitational force.<br></br>
